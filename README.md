# IntroCompStatsHSSP2023
Introduction to Computational Statistics for HSSP 2023

This GitHub repository contains all the code used for the lectures and mini-projects. We will be using Google Colab for this class, but you may use any IDE that works best for you. 

To access the code, navigate to the correct folder and there should be an option to open the code in Google Colab. It should be a blue button that says "Open on Colab." Click on the button and you will be redirected to Google Colab with the code loaded and ready to go. If you like, you can create a copy of the code inside your personal Google Drive. 

Alternatively, you can go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and click on GitHub. My username is stswee. Choose the repository stswee/IntroCompStatsHSSP2023 and click on the appropriate file to load in.
